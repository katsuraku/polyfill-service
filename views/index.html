		<h2 id="what-is-polyfillio">What is Polyfill.io?</h2>
		<p>It's a service which accepts a request for a set of browser features and returns only the polyfills that are
			needed by
			the requesting browser.</p>
		<h2 id="why-do-i-need-it">Why do I need it?</h2>
		<p>There are lots of differing browsers and browser versions in use throughout the world, each one has a slighly
			different
			set of features to the rest. This can make developing for browsers a difficult task. The latest versions of the
			popular
			browsers can do lots of things which older browsers can not â€“ but you may still have to support the older browsers.
			Polyfill.io
			makes it simpler to support differing browsers by attempting to recreate the missing features with polyfills: You
			can
			make use of the latest and greatest features in browsers which support them, and in those that do not.</p>
